I received and reviewed documentation prior to the hearing.

Innovation v George McLoughlin (PDD185)</b> held that the cognisable period was the six months prior to the submission of the complaint and allegations of penalisation after the date of submission were not admissible.</p><p>The Respondent requests that these complaints should be dismissed on the basis that they are statute-barred and the WRC has no jurisdiction to hear his complaints. </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p><h2>Findings and Conclusions:</h2><table><tbody><tr><td><p>The Respondent has raised a preliminary point in relation to the jurisdiction of the WRC to hear this complaint.   Section 41(6) of the Workplace Relations Act (2015) states:</p><p><i>“Subject to subsection (8), an adjudication officer shall not entertain a complaint referred to him or her under this section if it has been presented to the Director General after the expiration of the period of 6 months beginning on the date of the contravention to which the complaint relates”.</i></p><p>Section 41(8) of the Workplace Relations Act (2015) also states:</p><p><i>“An adjudication officer may entertain a complaint or dispute to which this section applies presented or referred to the Director General after the expiration of the period referred to in subsection (6) or (7) (but not later than 6 months after such expiration), as the case may be, if he or she is satisfied that the failure to present the complaint or refer the dispute within that period was due to reasonable cause”. </i></p><p>The facts of this case are that the Complainant was dismissed on 08/06/2023 and submitted he complaint to the WRC on 11/09/2024.  That is a period of one year, three months and three days.</p><p>At the hearing the Complainant stated that although his complaints are not out of time he should be granted a hearing.  He relies on the three points noted above to explain and justify his delay in submitting his complaints to the WRC.  It appears that the Complainant does not accept that Section 41(6) of the Workplace Relations Act requires a Complainant to set out a specific contravention of act of penalisation that occurred in the six-month period before lodging a claim, to ground a claim under the Act.</p><p>In relation to an extension of time the Labour Court in determination <b>DWT0338,</b>  <b>Cementation Skanska (formerly Kvaerner Cementation) v Carroll </b>the test for deciding if an extension of time should be granted for reasonable cause was outlined:</p><p><i>“Where and Adjudication Officer decides to consider a request for extension of time the onus is on the Complainant to satisfy the Adjudicator:</i></p><p><i>i.                     </i><i> Firstly, that the reason(s) relied upon both explain the delay and provide a justifiable excuse for same;</i></p><p><i>ii.                   </i><i>Secondly, that a causal connection exists between the reason proffered and the failure to apply in time;</i></p><p><i>iii.                 </i><i>Thirdly, that as a matter of probability, the complaint would have been presented in time but for the intervention of the factor(s) proposed as having directly caused delay in lodgement of complaint”.</i></p><p>The onus is on the Complainant to identify the reasons for the delay and to establish that the reasons relied upon can both explain and excuse the delay which satisfies the test of reasonable cause. </p><p>I appreciate that the Complainant has been dealing with this matter for some time.  However, in the circumstances of this case I cannot find that he has satisfied the test for establishing reasonable cause as required under Section 8(2) (b) of the 1977 Act. The Complainant has sought to explain the reasons for the late submission of his complaints I am a satisfied that the Complainant’s three reasons are not cogent reasons which would determine that there was reasonable cause for the delay in submitting the complaints.  In any event the complaints were submitted outside the period of time which an extension could provide.</p><p>At the hearing the Complainant was advised that Adjudication Officers of the WRC are creatures of statute and can only consider complaints submitted within the statutory time frame provided by relevant legislation.  A failure to present a complaint on time dislodges an Adjudication Officer of jurisdiction to hear the claim.</p><p>It is clear that the complaints in this case falls not only outside a period of six months but also the twelve-month extension period.  Consequently, I have no jurisdiction to hear and consider these complaints.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p><h1>Decision:</h1><p>Section 41 of the Workplace Relations Act 2015 requires that I make a decision in relation to the complaint(s) in accordance with the relevant redress provisions under Schedule 6 of that Act.</p><p>Section 8 of the Unfair Dismissals Acts, 1977 – 2015 requires that I make a decision in relation to the unfair dismissal claim consisting of a grant of redress in accordance with section 7 of the 1977 Act.</p><p> </p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>It is not disputed that these complaints in this case falls not only outside a period of six months but also the twelve-month extension period.  Consequently, I have decided that I have no jurisdiction to hear and consider these complaints.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p><p>Dated:   20th November 2025<b></b></p><p><b>Workplace Relations Commission Adjudication Officer:  </b>John Harraghy</p><p><b>Key Words:</b></p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>Time frame.  Reasonable cause. </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p></div><script type="text/javascript">
