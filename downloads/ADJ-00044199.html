The Respondent in their written submission has stated that the complaints “ought to have been lodged as one complaint to the WRC” and stated that the lodging of three separate complaints for three cognisable periods was an attempt to make up for negligent “drafting” by the Complainant and that the lodging of three separate complaints for three separate cognisable periods is “an attempt to artificially differentiate her claims to claim multiple awards of compensation”.</p><p> </p><p>By way of response to this submission, the Respondent has acknowledged in their written submission, the subject matter of the Complainant’s outstanding complaints overlaps in many respects with the disputes already heard by the WRC on 7th June 2023. However, this overlapping of issues does not exempt the Complainant from having to submit separate complaint forms for separate cognisable periods.</p><p> </p><p>The Respondent and the Adjudication Officer will be well aware that the Employment Equality Act 1998 grants jurisdiction to Adjudication Officers to address complaints confined to the cognisable period which is the 6 month period prior to the date of the submission of a complaint form to the WRC. Section 77 (5)(a) provides as follows:</p><p> </p><p><i>Subject to paragraph (b), a claim for redress in respect of discrimination or victimisation may not be referred under this section after the end of the period of 6 months from the date of occurrence of the discrimination or victimisation to which the case relates or, as the case may be, the date of its most recent occurrence.</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p>In fact, the Adjudication Officer in their written decision for ADJ – 00040270 acknowledged that he “cannot award compensation” after the date that the complaint form is received by the Workplace Relations Commission. In circumstances where the Complainant was subjected to discriminatory acts on the part of the Respondent after the date of the submission of the first complaint form, the Complainant had no option but to submit separate complaint forms seeking redress for these separate cognisable periods. Not only was the Complainant subjected to discriminatory behaviour which warrants an award of compensation, the Complainant incurred financial loss from January 2022 as a result of the Respondent’s decision to remove the Complainant from payroll.</p><p> </p><p>It is submitted on behalf of the Complainant that the Respondent has engaged in discriminatory acts in contravention of the Employment Equality Act 1998 from in or around September 2021. In circumstances where the Respondent continued to flagrantly discriminate against the Complainant for a period in excess of 6 months, the Complainant was left with no alternative but to submit separate complaint forms addressing the breaches of the Employment Equality Act 1998 by the Respondent.</p><p> </p><p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p><p>·       The within submissions are outline in nature only and are not intended to be read as</p><p>the Complainant’s entire position in respect of this case. The Complainant fully</p><p>reserves the right to adduce evidence at the hearing of this matter and to cross</p><p>examine the Respondent on their evidence.</p><p>·       The Respondent is a state-sponsored organisation responsible for the administration</p><p>and management of state funded social services with a registered address at Holbrook</p><p>House, Holles Street, Dublin 2.</p><p>·       The Complainant commenced employment with the Respondent on 12 May 2014 as a Support Officer in the Finance Directorate.</p><p>·       The Complainant was paid the sum of €1,773.14 gross on a monthly basis since in or around January 2017 when she began working on a part-time basis for the Respondent</p><p>·       On 31st January 2023 and 16th June 2023, the complainant submitted the within WRC Complaint Forms pursuant to the Employment Equality Act 1998 for discrimination on grounds of disability. This is the second and third complaint form submitted by the Complainant which addresses a second and third cognisable period during which, it is submitted on behalf of the Complainant, the Respondent continued to subject the Complainant to discriminatory behaviour in breach of the Employment Equality Act 1998. The Respondent discriminated against the complainant when it treated her less favourably than other employees by failing to reasonably accommodate the complainant in circumstances where she was unable to return to work on a full-time basis because of a diagnosed disability. The Complainant also submitted complaints pursuant to the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 and the Term of Employment (Information) Act 1994.</p><p>·       The Complainant seeks compensation due to the breach of this legislation by the Respondent.</p><p><b>BACKGROUND</b></p><p>·       By way of letter dated 7 May 2014 ,having interviewed for the role, the</p><p>Complainant was offered the position of Support Officer (G1) in the Respondent’s</p><p>Finance Directorate on a fixed term contract. A contract of employment for this</p><p>position was attached to the said letter and this was signed by the Complainant on 8</p><p>May 2014. The Complainant commenced her role with the Respondent on 12 May 2014.</p><p>·       By way of letter dated 8 September 2014, the Complainant was offered an extension to her fixed term contract of 8 May 2014 in the Respondent’s Finance Directorate.</p><p>·       On 1 December 2014, the Complainant was notified that she had successfully completed her probationary period.</p><p>·       In November 2017 the Complainant returned to work on a part-time basis.</p><p>·       On her return to work in November 2017 the Complainant met with Trevor Finnegan</p><p>and John Byrne of the Respondent. It was agreed that the Complainant would work a</p><p>3-day week in her role assisting with the Early Childhood Care and Education</p><p>Programme.</p><p>·       The Complainant was on sick leave from February 2019 to September 2019.</p><p>·       The Complainant returned to work in September 2019 assisting with the Community</p><p>Childcare Subvention Plus Saver Programme. The Complainant worked Monday to</p><p>Friday 10.00am – 2.00pm in this role.</p><p>·       On 12 March 2020 the Complainant went on sick leave.</p><p>·       On 15 March 2020 the Complainant was admitted to the Mater Hospital. The</p><p>Complainant was diagnosed with pneumonia.</p><p>·       The Complainant received treatment in the Mater Hospital until 21 March 2020 when</p><p>she was discharged.</p><p>·       In May 2020, the Respondent’s doctor, Dr McDermott, confirmed that the</p><p>Complainant was fit to return to work. <b><i></i></b></p><p>·       In May 2020, the Complainant returned to work. The Complainant was working</p><p>remotely as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>·       In January 2021 the Complainant was diagnosed with Covid-19 and admitted to the</p><p>Mater Hospital. As a result of same, the Complainant went on sick leave.</p><p>·       On 6 September 2021 the Complainant attended the Respondent’s doctor, Dr John</p><p>McDermott, for an occupational health assessment. During this meeting, the</p><p>Complainant informed Dr McDermott that she was “<i>targeting</i>” a return to work that</p><p>month. Dr McDermott recommended a “<i>phased</i>” return to work whereby she would</p><p>gradually return to her normal shift pattern of 20 hours per week. <b><i></i></b></p><p>·       In October 2021 the Complainant met with Trevor Finnegan and Celeste McCloskey to</p><p>discuss her return to work. At this meeting, Mr Finnegan informed the Complainant</p><p>that she could not continue working on a part-time basis and that her only option was</p><p>that she return to work on a full-time basis. The Complainant responded by stating</p><p>that she would not accept this offer.</p><p>·       On 29 October 2021 the Complainant received an email from Celeste McCloskey</p><p>informing her that she would be required to return to full-time work from January</p><p>2022.</p><p>·       On 15th December 2021 the Complainant received a letter from Celest McCloskey requiring the Complainant to attend the Respondent’s doctor for an assessment as to the complainant’s ability to return to full-time work in January 2022. In the same letter, the Respondent acknowledged that the Complainant’s sick leave certificate dated 7th December 2021, which had been prepared by the Respondent’s doctor , had stated that the complainant was not fit for full-time work.</p><p>·       On 15th December 2021 the Complainant received another letter from the Respondent  stating that they were unable to continue to facilitate the part-time arrangement of 20 hours per week and that she would be required to return to work on a full-time basis from January 2022.</p><p>·       On 17 December 2021 the Complainant emailed Ms McCloskey requesting that an appointment be scheduled for her to visit the Respondent’s doctor.</p><p>·       On 6 January 2022 the Complainant sent an email confirming her availability to attend a meeting with the Respondent’s doctor on 11 January 2022.</p><p>·       On 11 January 2022 the Complainant attended the Respondent’s doctor, Dr JohMcDermott, for an occupational health assessment. The Complainant informed Dr McDermott at this meeting that she continued to attend the “long COVID” Specialist clinic in the Mater Hospital. The Complainant reported persisting symptoms including reoccurring fatigue, dizziness and being lightheaded. The Complainant informed Dr McDermott that she intended to return to work on reduced hours and that both her Specialist in the Mater Hospital and her GP had endorsed the proposal that she return to work on a part-time basis. The Complainant stated that she wanted to retain the option of returning to full-time hours once she was medically fit to do so. Dr McDermott suggested that the Complainant work on a part-time basis for 12 weeks at which point she could be reassessed to consider whether she would be fit to return to full-time work. Dr McDermott said:-</p><p>“<i>In my opinion, Ms Carla Gahan is medically fit to work reduced (part-time)</i></p><p><i>hours for the next 12 weeks at which stage her progress might be reviewed</i></p><p><i>again</i>.”</p><p><b><i> </i></b></p><p>·       On 10 January 2022 the Complainant received an email from Ms McCloskey stating as</p><p>follows: -</p><p><i>Further to your email below.

The Respondent failed to inform the Complainant of her potential eligibility for critical illness payments despite having been on notice of her disability for in excess of 6 months.</p><p>·       On 25th May 2023 the Complainant attended Dr Kelvin Chong, Navan Road, Medical and Dental, Centric Health. In Dr Chong’s letter to the Respondent’s Doctor, Dr John McDermott, he makes reference to the fact that the Complainant was diagnosed with long covid and was attending the Mater Hospital Covid Clinic. Dr Chong stated that the Complainant was now attending the Infectious Disease Department in St Vincents Hospital to address her diagnosis of long covid. Dr Chong reported that the Complainant’s symptoms included fatigue and tiredness. In this letter Dr Chong also references the fact that the Complainant told him that she had been advised by the Respondent to increase her weekly workload by 5 hours until she returned to work on a full-time basis. In response to this suggestion, Dr Chong clearly states that in his opinion the Complainant would not be able to do this and recommended that the Complainant remain working for 20 hours a week until a later review.</p><p>·       On 15 June 2023, Dr John McDermott wrote to Liz Coyne the HR Business Partner of the Respondent. In this letter, Dr McDermott confirmed the above outlined view of Dr Kelvin Chong in the following terms:</p><p> </p><p><i>This is a complex caser but the objective medical evidence (as detailed by her GP) would lean towards a more gradual return to work …. perhaps facilitating Carla with a working @ 20 hours per week for the initial 3-4 months for example ….. and then review at that point. I would be happy to discuss.</i></p><p> </p><p>·       On 14 July 2023 the Complainant received an email from Liz Coyne of the Respondent in which the Respondent at long last agreed to implement a phased return to work which the Complainant’s and the Respondent’s Doctor had been recommending since September 2021.</p><p> </p><p><b>SUBSTANTIVE LEGAL SUBMISSION-EMPLOYMENT EQUALITY ACT 1998</b></p><p><b>Discrimination</b></p><p>·       Section 6 (1)(b) of the Employment Equality Act (as amended) (“the 1998 Act”)</p><p>provides that:</p><p><i>“(2) As between any 2 persons, the discriminatory grounds (and the</i></p><p><i>descriptions of those grounds for the purposes of this Act) are—</i></p><p><i>(g) that one is a person with a disability and the other either is not or is a person with a different disability (in this Act referred to as “the disability ground”)</i>”<i></i></p><p> </p><p><b>Definition of “disability”</b></p><p>·       Section 2(1) of the 1998 Act defines “<i>disability</i>” in the following terms:-</p><p><i>“(a) the total or partial absence of a person's bodily or mental functions,</i></p><p><i>including the absence of a part of a person's body,</i></p><p><i>(b) the presence in the body of organisms causing, or likely to cause, chronic</i></p><p><i>disease or illness,</i></p><p><i>(c) the malfunction, malformation or disfigurement of a part of a person's</i></p><p><i>body,</i></p><p><i>(d) a condition or malfunction which results in a person learning differently</i></p><p><i>from a person without the condition or malfunction, or</i></p><p><i>(e) a condition, illness or disease which affects a person's thought processes,</i></p><p><i>perception of reality, emotions or judgement or which results in disturbed</i></p><p><i>behaviour,</i></p><p><i>and shall be taken to include a disability which exists at present, or which</i></p><p><i>previously existed but no longer exists, or which may exist in the future or which</i></p><p><i>is imputed to a person;”</i></p><p>·       Section 6(1)(a) of the 1998 Act provides that:-</p><p>“<i>discrimination shall be taken to occur where a person is treated less favourably than another person is, has been or would be treated in a comparable situation on any of the grounds specified in subsection (2) (in this Act referred to as the ‘discriminatory grounds’) which —</i></p><p><i>i. exists</i></p><p><i>ii. existed but no longer exists,</i></p><p><i>iii. exists in the future, or</i></p><p><i>iv. is imputed to the person concerned,</i></p><p> </p><p><b>Burden of proof</b></p><p> </p><p>·       Section 85A(1) of the 1998 Act addresses the burden of proof and provides:-</p><p>“<i>where in any proceeding’s facts are established by or on behalf of a claimant</i></p><p><i>from which it may be presumed that there has been discrimination in relation</i></p><p><i>to him or her, it is for the Respondent to prove the contrary</i>.”</p><p>·       In <i>Mitchell v Southern Health Board </i>[2001] 12 ELR 201 the court set out the following</p><p>three part test as regards the onus that is on a Complainant to discharge the burden</p><p>of proof: -</p><p>“(<i>1) It is for the Complainant to prove the primary facts upon which he or she</i></p><p><i>relies in seeking to raise a presumption of discrimination.

For instance, two of these complaints refer to the Respondent’s alleged failure to reasonably accommodate her by not providing her with part-time hours, which she alleges to be discriminatory, and repeats the above referenced previously heard issues in additional complaints.</p><p> </p><p>It is a well-established principle that an employer cannot be vexed twice by the same complaint.

It should also be noted that the Respondent is currently awaiting a decision of this adjudication hearing.</p><p> </p><p>There is a well-established doctrine that a court should not again entertain a disputed issue which was or could have been decided previously. The well-known starting point for this doctrine is the judgment of <b>Wigram VC in Henderson v Henderson (1843) </b>3 Hare 100, from which the following passage is frequently cited:</p><p><i>‘… I believe I state the Rule of the Court correctly when I say that, where a given matter becomes the subject of litigation in, and of adjudication by, a Court of competent jurisdiction, the Court requires the parties to that litigation to bring forward their whole case, and will not (except under special circumstances) permit the same parties to open the same subject of litigation in respect of matter which might have been brought forward as part of the subject in contest, but which was not brought forward, only because they have, from negligence, inadvertence, or even accident, omitted part of their case. The plea of Res Judicata applies, except in special cases, not only to points upon which the Court was actually required by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce a judgment, but to every point which properly belonged to the subject of litigation, and which the parties exercising reasonable diligence might have brought forward at the time’”. </i></p><p> </p><p>It is the Respondent’s position that the entirety of the matters comprehended in the Complainant’s outstanding claims ought to have been lodged as one complaint to the WRC and that it is opportunistic of the Complainant to lodge several individual complaints whether out of negligence in the drafting of her original complaint, or in an attempt to artificially differentiate her claims to claim multiple awards of compensation.</p><p> </p><p>It is the Respondent’s position that many aspects of the claims that are to be heard today, appear substantially the same as each other, and further mirror her previous complaints. They thus ought to have been lodged as one. She ought not to seek compensation under multiple claim numbers for the same issues and certainly the WRC ought not permit same.</p><p><b> </b></p><p><b><i>Henderson v Henderson </i></b><i>was one of a number of authorities (including a number of Irish authorities to the same effect) considered by the Supreme Court in <b>Carroll v.

This Rule is often traced to the Judgment of Wigram VC in Henderson v. Henderson (1843) 3 Hare 100.” </i></p><p> </p><p>The learned Judge then quoted with approval the passage from the judgment of Wigram VC already set out above.</p><p> </p><p>The Respondent submits that in pursuing circa five outstanding complaints, in addition to the claims already heard, the Complainant is engaging in an abuse of process.</p><p>The Respondent notes the High Court’s commentary in <b>Morgan v the Labour Court and Ors </b>[2022] IEHC 361 in which the plaintiff’s actions were categorised in the following terms. “As we have seen, the appellant has engaged in the habitual and persistent institution of proceedings both before the WRC and in the courts in respect of issues related to her removal from her office as teacher with the Board, notwithstanding that hose issues have been the subject of binding and conclusive prior determinations. She has repeatedly engaged in the vexatious re-packaging of claims already determined against her. Indeed, she made clear to the Court during the hearing of the various matters before me that she intended to continue her campaign of proceedings.”</p><p> </p><p>The Respondent respectively requests that the Adjudicator deal with the preliminary matters first and foremost and reach a conclusion on same before deciding whether the substantive complaint under the Employment Equality Act, 1998 should be heard.</p><p> </p><p>In the case of <b>Employee v Employer UD969/2009</b>, the Employment Appeals Tribunal was asked to make a decision on a preliminary matter first before moving to hearing the substantive case.

This requires that the Complainant must first establish facts from which discrimination may be inferred. What those facts are will vary from case to case and there is no closed category of facts which can be relied upon. All that is required is that they be of sufficient significance to raise a presumption of discrimination. However, they must be established as facts on credible evidence. Mere speculation or assertions, unsupported by evidence, cannot be elevated to a factual basis upon which an inference of discrimination can be drawn. Section 85A places the burden of establishing the primary facts fairly and squarely on the Complainant and the language of this provision admits of no exceptions to that evidential rule”. </i></p><p> </p><p>The Labour Court in the case of <b><i>ICON Clinical Research and Tsourova (EDA 071) </i></b>stated that if:</p><p><i>“The Court is satisfied that if the complainant can establish facts from which discrimination can be inferred the onus of proving the absence of discrimination shifts to the respondent. The test normally applied by the Court to determine if the probative burden shifts to the Respondent is that formulated in Southern Health Board v Mitchell [2001] E.L.R. 201. This requires the complainant to prove the primary facts upon which he or she relies and to satisfy the Court that those facts are of sufficient significance to raise a presumption of discrimination.”</i></p><p>The Labour Court in <b><i>Southern Health Board v Mitchell, [2001] ELR 20</i></b>1 Court stated:</p><p><i>“The first requirement is that the complainant must establish facts from which it may be presumed that the principle of equal treatment has not been applied to them. This indicates that a complainant must prove, on the balance of probabilities, the primary facts on which they rely in seeking to raise a presumption of unlawful discrimination. </i></p><p><i>It is only if those primary facts are established to the satisfaction of the Court, and they are regarded by the Court as being of sufficient significance to raise a presumption of discrimination, that the onus shifts to the respondent to prove that there is no infringement of the principle of equal treatment”. </i></p><p> </p><p>In <b>Margetts v Graham Anthony &amp; Company Limited, EDA038,</b> the</p><p>evidential burden which must be discharged by the complainant before a <i>prima facie </i></p><p>case of discrimination can be said to have been established was further outlined by the Labour Court. The Labour Court stated as follows:</p><p><i>“The mere fact that the complainant falls within one of the discriminatory grounds laid down under the Act is not sufficient in itself to establish a claim of discrimination. The complainant must adduce other facts from which it may be inferred on the balance of probabilities that an act of discrimination has occurred.” </i></p><p> </p><p>In the instant case, the Complainant has alleged discrimination on the grounds of disability and failing to provide reasonable accommodation for a disability, but has hitherto produced not a shred of evidence to support this allegation.</p><p>The Complainant has not produced any evidence that such discrimination occurred and has failed to name a comparator against which such alleged unequal treatment may be judged. Furthermore, she has not set out how this alleged unequal treatment influenced the behaviour and decision making of the Respondent such that it resulted in the Complainant being the victim of discrimination.</p><p>The Respondent submits that it is only when the Complainant has discharged this burden to the satisfaction of an Adjudication Officer that the burden shifts to the Respondent to rebut the inference of discrimination raised. The Respondent submits that the Complainant has failed to discharge this burden of proof and, consequently, the claim cannot succeed.</p><p><b>Reasonable Accommodation </b></p><p>It is the Respondent’s position that the Complainant was not fully fit to perform the duties associated with her role. On 14 March 2022, the Complainant attended an occupational health assessment. The report place restrictions on her fitness to work meaning that the Complainant was unable to fulfil her contractual duties.</p><p>In response to the Complainant’s claim that the Respondent failed to reasonably accommodate her, it is the Respondent’s position that given the restrictions on the Complainant’s fitness to work, the Respondent was not in a position to allow the Complainant to return to work. The Respondent has a duty of care to all its staff in relation to their health, safety and welfare at work. By not permitting the Complainant to return to work before she was fully fit cannot be seen to amount to discrimination.</p><p>The Respondent proposed on multiple occasions to facilitate the Complainant’s return to work through proposing a phased return to work over an 8-week period to return to her full-time position, however the Complainant refused to do so. It has also been documented that the occupational health physician reached out to the Complainant to invite her to provider further or updated medical evidence from her own GP/Specialist.</p><p>The Respondent has acted in a reasonable and fair manner throughout the process. This is demonstrated through the Respondent’s communication with the Complainant to advise her of the option of applying for the Permanent Health Insurance Scheme with their external provider. The Respondent’s provider did make the decision that the Complainant did not qualify based on the medical evidence from occupational health, however it should be pointed out that this decision was not one of the Respondent but their external insurance provider.</p><p>The Respondent had made it clear to the Complainant that from the year 2022, the organisation has additional requirements for the Early Years Provider Centre (EYPC) with a new transition on funding, the core funding and NCS changes. Key to the EYPC is its fulltime advisors who support multiple programmes and offer various support and transactional services to ELC/SAC providers. It would require staff to have business hours of Monday to Friday 9:00am to 5:00pm. There is the need for all staff on board to work full time in conjunction with the new roles budgeted for EYC for 2022</p><p><b> </b></p><p><b>Complaint under Section 27 of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997. </b></p><p>In her complaint form, the Complainant alleges that the Respondent has failed to pay</p><p>the Complainant her annual leave entitlements accrued from 2022 and 2023 to date.</p><p>The Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997 section 20 (1) states,</p><p><b><i>20.</i></b><i>—(1) The times at which annual leave is granted to an employee shall be determined by his or her employer having regard to work requirements and subject— </i></p><p><i>(a) to the employer taking into account— </i></p><p><i>(i) the need for the employee to reconcile work and any family responsibilities, </i></p><p><i>(ii) the opportunities for rest and recreation available to the employee,</i></p><p>The Complainant had been on certified sick leave from the beginning of 2022 and was still on uncertified sick leave on the date that this complaint was lodged on 16 June 2023 and therefore could not avail of annual leave.</p><p>As the Complainant has since returned to work, she is of course more than welcome to apply for annual leave in line with the Respondent’s annual leave policy taking into consideration organisational requirements should she wish. It should also be noted that since her return from certified sick leave, the Complainant has availed of annual leave and has agreed additional leave days with her manager to be taken at future dates.</p><p><b> </b></p><p><b>Conclusion </b></p><p>The burden of proof rests with the Complainant to show that she has been treated less favourably on the grounds specified. It is the Respondent’s position that the Complainant has failed to provide facts from which it may inferred that discrimination has occurred and has therefore failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. It is also the Respondent’s position that the Complainant has been on a significant period of long-term absence and therefore could not apply for annual leave as she was on certified sick leave. It is the Respondent’s position that the Complainant can apply to take annual leave as in line with the organisation’s policy as she has now returned to the workplace. Without prejudice to the preliminary arguments, the Respondent respectfully submits that the claim must fail.</p><p> </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p><h2>Findings and Conclusions:</h2><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Preliminary Issue.</b></p><p>Two complaint forms were received from the complainant; details of these complaint forms are as follows:</p><p><b>Received 31st January 2023 – CA 00054793 – 001 / 002 / 003.</b></p><p>The cognisable period for this complaint is 31st July 2022 until 30th January 2023.</p><p><b>Received 16th June 2023 – CA -00057165 – 001 /002.</b></p><p>The cognisable period for this complaint is 16th December 2022 until 15th June 2023.</p><p>There is an overlap of approximately 6 weeks between 16th December 2022 and 30th January 2023.</p><p>The Respondent has referred to the bringing of these complaints pursuant to the Employment Equality Act 1998 as an “abuse of process”. The Respondent in their written submission has stated that the complaints “ought to have been lodged as one complaint to the WRC” and stated that the lodging of three separate complaints for three cognisable periods was an attempt to make up for negligent “drafting” by the Complainant and that the lodging of three separate complaints for three separate cognisable periods is “an attempt to artificially differentiate her claims to claim multiple awards of compensation”.</p><p> </p><p>By way of response the complainant representative has stated:</p><p> </p><p>“By way of response to this submission, the Respondent has acknowledged in their written submission, the subject matter of the Complainant’s outstanding complaints overlaps in many respects with the disputes already heard by the WRC on 7th June 2023. However, this overlapping of issues does not exempt the Complainant from having to submit separate complaint forms for separate cognisable periods.</p><p> </p><p>The Respondent and the Adjudication Officer will be well aware that the Employment Equality Act 1998 grants jurisdiction to Adjudication Officers to address complaints confined to the cognisable period which is the 6 month period prior to the date of the submission of a complaint form to the WRC. Section 77 (5)(a) provides as follows:</p><p> </p><p><i>Subject to paragraph (b), a claim for redress in respect of discrimination or victimisation may not be referred under this section after the end of the period of 6 months from the date of occurrence of the discrimination or victimisation to which the case relates or, as the case may be, the date of its most recent occurrence.</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p>In fact, the Adjudication Officer in their written decision for ADJ – 00040270 acknowledged that he “cannot award compensation” after the date that the complaint form is received by the Workplace Relations Commission. In circumstances where the Complainant was subjected to discriminatory acts on the part of the Respondent after the date of the submission of the first complaint form, the Complainant had no option but to submit separate complaint forms seeking redress for these separate cognisable periods.”</p><p> </p><p>Whilst the complaints may appear to be the same they are in fact different and what makes them different is the cognisable period. I conclude on this point that the complaints are properly before me.</p><p><b> </b></p><p><b>Substantive Issue.</b></p><p>On 19 September 2022, the Complainant attended the Respondent’s doctor, Dr</p><p>McDermott who again confirmed that the Complainant was not to return to full-time</p><p>work as a result of her long Covid diagnosis.</p><p> </p><p>On 1 March 2023, the Complainant attended the Respondent’s doctor, Dr McDermott who suggested a phased return to work.</p><p> </p><p>On 25th May 2023 the Complainant attended Dr Kelvin Chong, Navan Road, Medical and Dental, Centric Health. In Dr Chong’s letter to the Respondent’s Doctor, Dr John McDermott, he makes reference to the fact that the Complainant was diagnosed with long covid and was attending the Mater Hospital Covid Clinic. Dr Chong stated that the Complainant was now attending the Infectious Disease Department in St Vincents Hospital to address her diagnosis of long covid. Dr Chong reported that the Complainant’s symptoms included fatigue and tiredness. In this letter Dr Chong also references the fact that the Complainant told him that she had been advised by the Respondent to increase her weekly workload by 5 hours until she returned to work on a full-time basis. In response to this suggestion, Dr Chong clearly states that in his opinion the Complainant would not be able to do this and recommended that the Complainant remain working for 20 hours a week until a later review.</p><p>On 15 June 2023, Dr John McDermott wrote to Liz Coyne the HR Business Partner of the Respondent. In this letter, Dr McDermott confirmed the above outlined view of Dr Kelvin Chong in the following terms:</p><p><i>“This is a complex caser but the objective medical evidence (as detailed by her GP) would lean towards a more gradual return to work …. perhaps facilitating Carla with a working @ 20 hours per week for the initial 3-4 months for example …. and then review at that point. I would be happy to discuss”</i></p><p>In July 2023 the respondent eventually accepted the medical opinions they appeared to have been ignoring since September 2021.</p><p> </p><p>Disability/Reasonable Accommodation</p><p> </p><p>The Act does not require an employer to recruit, promote or continue to employ a person who is unable to perform the duties of the job in question. But that proposition is significantly circumscribed in the case of disability, by the obligation which the Act places on employers to provide an employee who has a disability with reasonable accommodation, referred to in the Act as “appropriate measures”. The purpose of providing reasonable accommodation is to enable a person who has a disability :</p><p> </p><p>(1)    To have access to employment,</p><p>(2)    To participate or advance in employment, or</p><p>(3)    To undergo training.</p><p> </p><p>There is no limitation on the type or category of measures that an employer can be expected to take, provided that they do not involve a disproportionate cost. It can involve effective and practical measures, where needed in a particular case, to adapt the employer’s place of business to the disability concerned. It may, in particular, involve the adaptation of premises and equipment, patterns of working time, distribution of tasks or the provision of training or integration of resources.</p><p> </p><p>Before deciding to dismiss an employee with a disability because of their incapacity, an employer is first obliged to establish the factual position concerning the nature and extent of the employee’s condition and its likely duration. If it is believed that the employee is not capable of performing the duties of their job the employer must consider what, if any, special facilities or appropriate measures could be provided so as to allow the employee to continue in employment (<b>Determination EDA 0359, A Worker v A Health and Fitness Club.</b> This decision of the Labour Court was upheld on appeal and is reported as <b>Humphries v Westwood Club [2004] 15 ELR 296).W</b></p><p> </p><p>The leading authority on the obligations of an employer to provide reasonable accommodation to an employee with a disability is the decision of the Supreme Court in <b><i>Nano Nagle School v Daly</i> [2019] IESC 63 and [2019] 30 E.L.R 221. </b>Here the Supreme Court clarified the law as follows:</p><p> </p><p>·       <i>The primary obligation of an employer in relation to an employee with a disability is to take appropriate measures, where required in a particular case, to enable the employee to, inter alia, continue employment.</i></p><p>·       <i>That duty includes an obligation to consider relieving the employee with a disability of such duties as they cannot perform.</i></p><p>·       <i>No distinction should be drawn for that purpose between duties and tasks or between core duties or essential duties.</i></p><p>·       <i>The duty to provide reasonable accommodation does not extend to an obligation to create an entirely new job.</i></p><p>·       <i>A reorganised job is not necessarily a new job. It is a matter of degree to be decided on the facts of the case.</i></p><p>·       <i>A wise employer will consult with the employee with a disability before making decisions about their future employment. However, a failure to consult does not amount to discrimination for the purposes of the Act.</i></p><p>·       <i>The employee with a disability must be fully capable of performing the duties of the position, after it is modified by the application of reasonable accommodation, which can include relieving the employee of the requirement to perform certain duties which they cannot perform. </i></p><p><i> </i></p><p>I note para 107 from <b><i>Nano Nagle School v Daly</i> [2019] IESC 63:</b></p><p><b> </b></p><p><i>107. Once consultation, or other necessary steps for compliance , have been taken, an employing entity may have to ask itself the ultimate question whether having explored the modes of accommodation , and if, prudently having consulted with an employee, the position , as defined in s.16(1), is, in fact, capable of adaptation so as to accommodate that claimant, and whether the claimant would be capable of performing that function thus adapted. But it is that “position” or job, not another one. If there is a challenge to this decision, this must be assessed objectively by the tribunal vested with the statutory duty of carrying out such an enquiry and also vested with the expertise to carry out such assessment. If, on reasonable accommodation, a claimant is unable to fully undertake the duties attached to the position, then the Act provides there can be no finding of discrimination.</i></p><p>In the instant case the Respondent has adopted the position that the Complainant was not fully fit to perform the duties associated with her role. On 14th March 2022, the complainant attended an occupational health assessment. The report place restrictions on her fitness to work meaning that the complainant was unable to fulfil her contractual duties. The Respondent then states that the proposal that the complainant should return to work over an 8-week period was refused by the complainant.</p><p>Looking at the reports from the respondent’s occupational health specialist, these include the following:</p><p><b>11th January 2022 (visit to occupational health specialist)  - </b></p><p><i>“In my opinion, Ms Carla Gahan is medically fit to work reduced (part-time) hours for the next 12 weeks at which stage her progress might be reviewed again”.</i></p><p><b>14th March 2022</b> (<b>visit to occupational health specialist) – </b></p><p>“<i>Ms Carla Gahan is continuing to struggle with post-COVID-19 (‘long Covid’)</i></p><p><i>symptoms.

I would be happy to discuss.</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p>These reports from the respondent’s own occupational health advisor consistently state that the complainant is fit to work reduced (part-time) hours, they do not state that the complainant is unfit for work. It would appear that the advice from the respondent’s occupational health specialist has, to a very great extent, been ignored by the respondent.</p><p> </p><p>In coming to a conclusion in this matter I find that the complaint as presented under the Employment Equality Act 1998 is well founded.</p><p> </p><p>Section 82 of the Act looks at redress which may be ordered:</p><p> </p><p><i>82 (1) Subject to this section, the types of redress for which a decision of the Director under section 79 may provide are such one or more of the following as may be appropriate in the circumstances of the particular case:</i></p><p><i>(c) an order for compensation for the effects of acts of discrimination or victimisation which occurred not earlier than 6 years before the date of the referral of the case under section 77.</i></p><p><i> </i></p><p>I now order the Respondent to pay compensation to the Complainant in the sum of €30,000 (thirty thousand euro) in full and final settlement of this complaint.

It should also be noted that since her return from certified sick leave, the Complainant has availed of annual leave and has agreed additional leave days with her manager to be taken at future dates. </i></p><p><i> </i></p><p>I am satisfied that this matter will be addressed in-house now that the complainant has returned to work and will make no decision in relation to this complaint.</p><p><b> </b></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p><p> </p><h1>Decision:</h1><p>Section 41 of the Workplace Relations Act 2015 requires that I make a decision in relation to the complaint(s) in accordance with the relevant redress provisions under Schedule 6 of that Act.</p><p>Section 79 of the Employment Equality Acts, 1998 – 2015 requires that I make a decision in relation to the complaint in accordance with the relevant redress provisions under section 82 of the Act.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>In coming to a conclusion in this matter I find that the complaint as presented under the Employment Equality Act 1998 is well founded.</p><p>I now order the Respondent to pay compensation to the Complainant in the sum of €30,000 (thirty thousand euro) in full and final settlement of this complaint.
